## Description
We will be making a site with the primary function of allowing students to see important information about their teachers â€”- most importantly, emails, course syllabi, and free periods/office hours. There will be a student login (using Google) where students will be able to see all this information and a teacher login (also using Google) where teachers can update their information.

## API Stuff

## Launch Codes
1. Clone repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Lucas-Lee11/P04.git
$ cd P04
```

2. Create a new virtual environment
```
$ python3 -m venv env_name
$ source env_name/bin/activate
```

3. Install project dependencies
```
(env_name) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app
```
(env_name) $ python3 loophole.py
```
Access the app by going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Alternatively, use our deployed droplet: http://137.184.158.41/

## Deployment on a Server
The following instructions are intended for deployment on a DigitalOcean droplet. They are current as of June 1, 2022.
1. Set up a DigitalOcean droplet with Ubuntu 20.04.3 and Apache2. Instructions [here](https://github.com/Clue88/softdev-workshop/tree/main/24_lamp).

2. Install and enable WSGI. When you deploy a new app, you won't need to install the system dependencies again.
```
$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 python-dev
$ sudo a2enmod wsgi
```

3. Install the app. (Note: typically, we would recommend using a virtual environment. However, sudo pip3 seems to bypass virtual environments anyway--please submit a PR if you figure out how to fix that--so we're going to ignore that for now.)
```
$ cd /var/www
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/Lucas-Lee11/P04.git
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ cd P04
$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure your virtual host. Note: you can use any text editor (nano, etc.) in place of vim. Replace DROPLET_IP_ADDRESS and USERNAME as appropriate.
```
$ sudo vim TeacherTally.conf
```
You should see the following template in the `.conf` file:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName DROPLET_IP_ADDRESS
    ServerAdmin USERNAME@DROPLET_IP_ADDRESS
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/P04/TeacherTally.wsgi
    <Directory /var/www/P04/app/>
        Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
    </Directory>
    Alias /static /var/www/P04/app/static
    <Directory /var/www/P04/app/static/>
        Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Note: In order to deploy multiple apps, you won't be able to deploy both at the top-level route. You can change the `WSGIScriptAlias` from `/` and `/static` to `P04` and `P04/static`.

Save and close the file. For vim users, type `:wq`.

5. Move the `.conf` file to the correct location.
```
$ sudo cp TeacherTally.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/TeacherTally.conf
```

6. Enable the virtual host.
```
$ sudo a2ensite TeacherTally
```
To disable your site, use
```
$ sudo a2dissite TeacherTally
```

7. Change the permissions on your database file.
Run the following. This will likely cause an error--it is necessary to generate the database file.
```
$ python3 loophole.py
```
Next, change the owner of the database file to `www-data`.
```
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data loophole.db
$ sudo chmod 755 loophole.db
$ sudo mkdir tmp
$ sudo mv loophole.db tmp/loophole.db
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data tmp
$ sudo chmod 755 tmp
```
Lastly, fix the path to the database file in `app/database.py`.
```
$ sudo vim app/database.py
```
Replace `loophole.db` with `tmp/loophole.db`.

8. Apply deployment fixes.
Uncomment the `if __name__ == "__main__"` line at the bottom of `app/__init__.py`
and indent the following `app.run()`.

9. Add OAuth secret files (see 411 on GoogleAuth API and `app/keys/readme`).

10. Restart apache.
```
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```

9. Test your app by going to `http://DROPLET_IP_ADDRESS` in a web browser.
