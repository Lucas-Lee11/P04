## Description
We will be making a site with the primary function of allowing students to see important information about their teachers â€”- most importantly, emails, course syllabi, and free periods/office hours. There will be a student login (using Google) where students will be able to see all this information and a teacher login (also using Google) where teachers can update their information.
